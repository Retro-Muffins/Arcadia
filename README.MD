# Arcadia

welcome, this is the public repository of the RPGMaker MV project for Arcadia by Retro Muffins, a video game created for CMPUT 250 (Fall 2022) at the Unversity of Alberta

## collaboration policy

- WIP branches will be named after the person working on that branch (`chester`, `jeff`, `tanner`, etc)
- pull requests to the master branch will require review from the lead designer and at least one other member (members can tag other members to request review if needed)
- please be careful before pushing to remote - once your commits are on github, you can't remove them!

### ID Naming Policy
(whenever possible, try to use underscore_case instead of CamelCase etc)

  1. Quests: `levelQ#`
     - e.g. `introQ0`, `chadQ4`, `twinsQ2`, ...
  2. Maps: `level_room` 
     - e.g. `twins_hub`, `intro_alexsroom`, ...
  3. Items: `quest_itemname`
     - e.g. `_camera`, `twinsQ1_teddybear`, `ragerQ3_mtndew`, ...
